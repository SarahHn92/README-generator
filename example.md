   ## Description
  This project is a short, basic quiz on JavaScript. It was built to practice writing JavaScript as a project assigned by my teachers at Trilogy/USyd and has been a valuable tool in beginning to understand Javascript syntax and functionality. The general purpose of the Code Quiz is to answer a short array of general questions on JavaScript. For every incorrect answer, 10 seconds is deducted from your time remaining and the time you are left with at the end is your final score.
